# Keeping one of each type

- [Connectible Chains](https://modrinth.com/mod/connectible_chains): Chains can be tied to fences and walls. (Has a dependency)

This is separate from the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/#installation). Essentially, the loader loads

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api): The core set of functionality provided by Fabric. Assume every Fabric mod makes use of this.

1. [3D Crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3d-crops): Provides 3D models for all crops, flowers, and saplings in vanilla Minecraft.
3. [Stay True](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stay-true) (Requires Optifine for many features.): A texture pack very similar to the default Minecraft texture pack, but much improved (in my opinion).
- [Complementary Shaders Unbound](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound)
- [Towers of the Wild](https://modrinth.com/datapack/towers-of-the-wild-reworked): Adds "Breath of the Wild"-like tower structures to the world. These towers have built-in support for *Waystones*.
- Visual only (can use on public vanilla servers)
  - [LambdaBetterGrass](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdabettergrass): Grass-like blocks connect in a much nicer way. They won't be constrained to only the top of blocks.
  - [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn): Adds support for Optifine's CIT texture format. While not useful on its own, this will allow some assets and resource packs made for Optifine (like *Xali's Enchanted Books*) to work properly.

- Performance and optimization group. Use instead of Optifine. (Can use on public vanilla servers.)
  - [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium): Replaces the game's rendering engine with one which is much faster.
2. [xali's Enchanted Books](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xalis-enchanted-books): Provides unique textures for every enchanted book in vanilla Minecraft. (Using CurseForge link because it doesn't look like he's updating the Modrinth Page).

I don't know why this is a texture pack (it's a data pack), but at least the page layout is different: [sky-villages-waystones-compat](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/sky-villages-waystones-compat)
- Noice [Sky Villages Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sky-villages-fabric)
