# TODO

- Use asynchronous http requests - maybe [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
- Recursively resolve dependencies
- Cache already retrieved projects and versions
- Output links for mods, resource packs, plugins, datapacks, and shaders into separate files. I'll also need a file for items which need to be downloaded manually.
